## apt-strict

Utility to install precise versions of exactly pointed dependencies: libxx=1.2.3

apt-get, against expectations, in this case installs most recent avaliable version of libxx. Sometimes this is not desirable. For example, if you distribute your software to servers with packages, and can not split testing/stable package versions by different repositories.

Check --help for avaliable options.
