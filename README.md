## apt-strict

Utility to install precise versions of exactly pointed dependencies: libxx=1.2.3

apt-get, against expectations, in this case installs most recent avaliable version of libxx. Sometimes this is not be desirable, especially if you distribute software to servers with packages. 

Check --help for avaliable options.
