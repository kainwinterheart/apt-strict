## apt-strict

Utility to install precise versions of exactly pointed dependencies: libxx=1.2.3

apt-get, against expectations, in this case installs most recent avaliable version of libxx. Sometimes this is not desirable: if you distribute your software to servers with packages, and can not split testing/stable versions by different repositories.

Check --help for avaliable options.
